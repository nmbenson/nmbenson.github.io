   <h2>Designing for Mobile</h2>
   <p> Using a regular web site on a mobile phone can drastically change your experience when surfing the web. If you were to try and read very small text, chances are you are on a desktop website that you are viewing on your smartphone.

A web page designed on a mobile phone is meant to give you a seamless experience. A mobile website is meant to be designed beautifully and be the same on all phone screens. Since smartphone users are more interested in practical design flow, a mobile website allows the use of bigger fonts and graphics while avoiding the use of extra, unneeded code.

A mobile website is successful because it features easy to read navigation and is streamlined over all devices. One touch information makes everything easy to use. Smartphones in the work world have made mobile websites more common and optimized to help in potential sales and customers. When surfing the web for a service,  good business can be seen through clean and straightforward design.

Responsive design is another great part of mobile web design. A responsive website means the website it will respond on any platform used. For example, if you open a website on your desktop it will take you to a website but open it on your mobile phone and you will see a mobile website, that is a responsive website. Using a responsive page loads the data more quickly also and in today’s age, we like fast loading pages that are easy to access.

A big part of mobile web can be divided into a few key sections:
Keep it simple, create clean flow, minimal use of images, and use key features in to intergrade the phone with your design.
